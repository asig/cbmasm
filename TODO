#TODOs
[X] Add defines on the command line
[X] Add Z80 assembler for C128 mode
[X] Add characters literals
[X] PETSCII encoding
[X] Add "screen encoding" function
[X] Support proper value range in Nodes
[X] Move "checkRange" call into Nodes
[X] generate listings
[X] Add string constants also for .equ and conditional compilation
[X] introduce "platform"
    [ ] only allow Z80 code when platform is C128
[ ] .fail implementation:
    [ ] allow comma separated list of messages
    [ ] Allow symbols in message
[X] turn "platform" into a directive
    [ ] Allow override in the code only if no other directive (except macro def) has been executed
[X] store value of ".cpu" in symbol table
[X] LDx/STx should use zero page addressing if possible (example: "dp .equ $fb; sta dp" should generate $85 $FB, not $8D $FB $00)
[ ] scr() can't be part of expressions in e.g lda #scr(' ')
[ ] generate object files and add a linker

#BUGs
[X] local labels in macros are not cleared when the macro is finished. Potential fix: remove labels that were generated in the macro
[X] listing repeats macro line
[X] Macros report local labels as undefined if they're passed in as a param
[X] Undefined labels should be reported at reference sites, not the end of the code.
[X] Word constants are not always 2 bytes
